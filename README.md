# Data Structures: Python Implementations

## Content Overview:
Below is an overview of some Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and my implementations of them using Python, including a summary of their worst case Time Complexities.

## Introduction:
Data structures provide ways of storing and organizing data in computer memory and fall into two broad categories: Linear and Non-Linear.

## Linear Data Structures:

* ## Queue
Queues are a collection (or sequence) type data structure, meaning they hold collections of objects, organized along the **First-In-First-Out (F.I.F.O)** principle. The element at the front of the queue is the one that is returned. This happens successively until the last element is extracted from the back of the queue, similar to how human queues for customer service operate.
**Queues have 2 defining methods**:  

 * **enqueue(e)** - Adds element e the back of the queue.
 * **dequeue()** - Returns and removes the element currently at the front of the queue.



* ## Stack
Stacks are another collection type data structure but are organized along the **Last-In-First-Out (L.I.F.O)** principle. Akin to a stack of plates, the last element added is the first to be removed from the stack. **Stacks have 2 defining methods**:

 * **push(e)** - Adds element e to the top of the stack.
 * **pop()** - Returns and removes the element at the top of the stack.
